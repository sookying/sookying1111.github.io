            <summary>2. Why I don't receive SMS pin code to verify phone number?</summary>
            <p>Regarding the SMS pin, we rely on a third-party service provider and sometimes there could be some disruptions in the SMS delivery. <br>
                We hope to get it sorted out soonest possible.
                Please restart your phone and retry generating SMS pin again.<br>
                Also please ensure that your internet connection is decent when doing so. This step normally resolve the issue due to update of your carrier settings</p>
