            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Our founder, Dato’ Chevy Beh, first came up with the idea for BookDoc after his good friend Wayne’s near-death experience with Dengue Fever. 
                When Wayne first began to feel ill, he underwent blood testing at his doctor’s office and was sent home with negative results. His fever receded, leading him 
                to believe that he was on the road to recovery, but three days later his condition suddenly took a turn for the worse. When he went to see his usual General Practitioner, 
                Wayne was told that he had to go to the hospital immediately.</p>
            <p>While enduring the long wait at the hospital to be admitted, Wayne noticed that his gums started bleeding and he began to feel drastically ill. Panicked, Wayne gave Beh a call 
                and luckily Beh was able to arrange for Wayne’s immediate admission. The attending physician mentioned that had Wayne been admitted any later, his life would have been at risk.</p>
            <p>Inspired by his close friend’s near-death experience and being a seasoned player in the healthcare industry, Beh pledged to do something to address the inefficiencies and information 
                asymmetries in healthcare. He founded BookDoc with the goal of improving the timeliness of diagnosis and helping patients to find appropriate care.</p>
